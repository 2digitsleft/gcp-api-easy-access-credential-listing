## Easily Unlock Google APIs: "Easy Access Credential Listing"
Easily Unlock Google APIs: Streamline your Google Cloud Platform (GCP) credential management with this Python script. It organizes API credentials in one place, offering a simple selection interface for efficient access to Google services.

## Introduction
I've always been slightly irked by the hassle of locating and managing credentials for using Cloud Service Provider (CSP) APIs in scripts within my scripts. It's a challenge to neatly and securely organize them in the command line and project directories, especially during testing phases. To streamline this process, I developed a script that consumes all project credential files from a single folder â€” subfolders included. This setup simplifies the selection of credentials when launching the Python script.

**Hint:** This setup is only intended to be used for testing, not production releases, as storing all credential files in one folder is not necessarily best practice from a security point of view. 

## Description
This script facilitates exemplarily the use of Google APIs, in this case with Google Slides API for managing Google Slides, through authentication and setup of the necessary credentials. It's designed for applications that need to automate tasks on Google APIs or access Google APIs data programmatically. The script employs the Google Client Library for Python to handle OAuth 2.0 authentication, manage API requests, and display credentials in a user-friendly format.

BTW: This could be easily integrated into other applications using Google Cloud or Google Wokplace APIs. 

## Prerequisites

- **Python 3.x:** Ensure Python is installed on your system.
Google Cloud Platform Project: You need a project on Google Cloud Platform (GCP) with the Google Slides API enabled.
- **OAuth 2.0 Client IDs:** Generate and download the credentials (in JSON format) for your application from the Google Cloud Console. This will be used to authenticate your application with Google.
- **Dependencies:** Install the required Python libraries (google-auth, google-auth-oauthlib, google-auth-httplib2, google-api-python-client, rich) using pip:

```pip install google-auth google-auth-oauthlib google-auth-httplib2 google-api-python-client rich```

## Setup and Use

- **Store Google API Credentials:** Place your downloaded JSON credential file(s) in a known directory. If you have multiple credentials, you can store them all in this directory.
- **Environment Variable:** Set an environment variable GOOGLE_CREDENTIALS_FOLDER to the path of the directory containing your credentials file(s). This can be done in your shell's configuration file (e.g., .bashrc, .zshrc) or in your application's runtime environment:

```export GOOGLE_CREDENTIALS_FOLDER=/path/to/your/credentials_folder```

- **Executing the Script:** Run the script in your Python environment. The script performs the following operations:
- **Reading Credentials:** It reads all .json credential files in the specified directory and identifies them as either service or user accounts based on the presence of the client_email field in the JSON.
- **Displaying Credentials:** Presents a table of the available credentials, asking the user to select which one to use. This is particularly useful if there are multiple credentials and the script is being used interactively.
- **Authentication:** Once a credential is selected, the script attempts to authenticate with Google using these credentials. If the selected credential has been used before and a token.pickle file exists, it will try to use this token for authentication. If the token is not valid (e.g., expired), the script will refresh it if possible, or prompt for re-authentication through a local server flow.
- **Google Slides Service:** After authentication, the script initializes the Google Slides service, which can then be used to make API calls to manage Google Slides presentations.

## Important Notes

- **Scope Modification:** If you modify the GOOGLE_SCOPES variable to add or remove scopes, you must delete the token.pickle file to ensure that the correct permissions are requested during the next authentication flow.
- **Security:** Store your credentials securely and ensure the token.pickle file, which contains sensitive access tokens, is not exposed to unauthorized users.
- **Rate Limits and Quotas:** Be aware of the Google API's rate limits and quotas. Excessive requests may result in your application being temporarily blocked from making further requests.
- **Integration in your own apps/scripts:** The script only proviedes the logic, you need to integrate this in your own script to actually consume these features. 
An example is the "GWS Translate Slides" reporitory providing a script to translate texts in Google Slides from one source language into a target language.

This script is designed for developers or users with basic programming and Google Cloud Platform knowledge, aiming to automate interactions with Google Slides through a custom Python application.
